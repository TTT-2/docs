# Using TTT2 on your Server

TTT2 is intended to be used as a 'normal' Addon so you don't need to (and shouldn't) overwrite any garrysmod files with it. Don't remove the standard `terrortown` gamemode either, as TTT2 depends on that to work. Simply put the [TTT2 Workshop Addon](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1357204556) into your servercollection and you are good to go!

You can also use the [GitHub Version of TTT2](https://github.com/TTT-2/TTT2/) and put it in your `addons` folder. But keep in mind that our GitHub Version is our development build therefore might not as well tested and/or unstable.
