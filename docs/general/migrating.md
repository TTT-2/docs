# Migrating to TTT2

# General Info

When migrating from a different TTT version to TTT2, not many things have to be considered. Like explained in our [troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting/index.md), you want to check the addonchecker output to make sure no incompatible addons are installed.

On a different note it should be mentioned that while it is possible to get a nearly identical experience with the available roles for TTT2, there are [quite a few unique roles available](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1737053146).

## Migrating from Vanilla TTT

Besides checking compatiblility with addons, not much has to be considered. Use the aforementioned addonchecker to make sure your addons are up to date. In general addons that modify the HUD and rely on hardcoded roles are not compatible with TTT2.

If you want some inspiration for a working TTT2 collection, check out [our official server collection](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1379909176). Feel free to (re-)use it.

## Migrating from Town of Terror
