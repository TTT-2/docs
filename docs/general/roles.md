## Reasons to use

You don't want the Traitors to feel as safe? Just add any of the **Neutral Killers** to your server. Now even Traitors have to fear getting killed!

You want the Innocents to think twice before they shoot? Add the **Jester** and/or **Wrath** to your server.

Having the same number of Traitors each round is boring? Add the **Amnesiac** and/or **Bodyguard** to your server.

Traitors having Credits from the start of the round feels opressive? Add the **Hitman** to your server and make them earn their credits!
